# Snake Game in Pygame

This project was created as part of an experiment to evaluate the coding capabilities of various AI models. The following AI models were given the same prompt to create a Snake Game:
- **GPT-4.5**
- **GPT-4o**
- **Claude 3.7**
- **Deepsek**
- **Cursor-auto-mod**

The goal was to observe how well these AI models could generate clean, functional, and optimized code for a Python game using Pygame. Each AI's output was reviewed and combined to create the final version of this game.

# Prompt

Create a Python Snake Game in Pygame with smooth controls, increasing difficulty, and a scoring system. Add a retro arcade UI and bonus power-ups for extra fun. Keep the code clean and optimized.

## Features
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive and intuitive gameplay.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The game becomes more challenging as you progress.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your high scores.
- **Retro Arcade UI**: A nostalgic design for a classic gaming experience.
- **Bonus Power-Ups**: Collect power-ups for extra points or special abilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
